      <p  class = "common-sentence">
         My name is Kota Mukai,<br>
         a graduate student, independent developer, and entrepreneur based in Japan.<br><br>
         I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Physical Education Pedagogy<br>
         at the University of Tsukuba, where my research focuses on improving methods<br>
         for teaching physical education in schools.<br><br>

      <h2 class = "common-header">Career Vision</h2>
      <p  class = "common-sentence">
         Upon completing my graduate studies in March 2026, I will begin my career<br>
         as an IT consultant at a leading global systems integrator.<br>
         To strengthen my technical foundation, I started learning Java in April 2025<br>
         and have since been actively developing projects as an independent developer.<br><br>
         Through this journey, I discovered a deep passion for coding and software development.<br>
         Looking ahead, I aspire to transition into a software engineering role<br>
         and am committed to continuously expanding my technical expertise.<br>
         I remain open to opportunities that allow me to grow as an engineer<br>
         and contribute to innovative solutions.
